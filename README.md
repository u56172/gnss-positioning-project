# GNSS-Positioning-Project
The project in the Satellite Navigation Systems course at Military University of Technology (WAT) under the supervision of Dr. Eng. Damian Kiliszek

## Project Objectives
1. Determining the GNSS receiver position using Bancroft's method
2. Calculating troposphetic delay
3. Applying the least squares method and using the ionospheric-free linear combination to determine the GNSS receiver position - development of GNSS observation equations
